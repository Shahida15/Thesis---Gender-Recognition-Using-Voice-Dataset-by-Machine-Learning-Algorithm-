# Thesis-CSE498R--Gender-Recognition-Using-Voice-Dataset-by-Machine-Learning-Algorithm- 
Gender recognition using voice is an important research topic that is currently widely used in many applications including security systems and authentication. By applying the same method to gender classification using voice, we will find voice recognition as a better performing technique, which will increase the performance even more than before. This gender classification based on gender recognition alone has limited the problem space for speech recognition.
